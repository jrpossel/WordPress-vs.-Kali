# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: __________________

Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Green

Vulnerability #1: UserName Enumberation 
>When the class "failure" is called the "Log in was unsuccessful" is bolded, however in green when the username does not exist then a class "failed" is called which does not bold the message.

Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference
>Looking at the URL of a sales person:
>>https://35.192.92.97/red/public/salesperson.php?id=1
The ID is able to be changed and when changed to 10 displays the page for a sales person who is not yet publlic.

Vulnerability #2: __________________
